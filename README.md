Firstly, MaxDEL uses machine learning method to calibrate the deletions regions from variant 
call format (VCF) file. Secondly, it develops a novel feature visualization method 
to convert the variant features to images and uses these images to accurately call the dele-
tions based on convolutional neural network (CNN).
